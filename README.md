# Prework Study Guide webpae

## Description

I wanted to take part in this course as I have always had an interest in code and technology and wanted to get the most out of my interests and skillset and hopefully utilise these new found skills so that I can get into a career I will enjoy. 

The study guide I have built provides a useful way to keep track of my notes as well as putting my learning to practice.

I can easily find my notes by visiting this page and see a clearly structured set of notes.

I have learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript and will continue to develop my knowledge.

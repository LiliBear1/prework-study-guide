        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

           <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
           <li>There are six head elements, "h1" is the largest and 6 is the smallest, you should only use "h1" once</li>
           <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
           <li>The "p" element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
           <li>The "br" element creates a line break between two blocks of content</li>
           <li>The "a" element is an anchor and creates links to the same or other web pages</li>
           <li>"href" is an attribute which will point to a URL for a link, you need to consider this for things like CSS style sheets</li>
           <li>There are three different list types; "ul" is an unordered list, "ol" is an ordered list and "li" allows you to list items</li>
           <li>The "img" element contains information about images displayed on the webpage and the "src" attribute is most important here as it defines the location of the image</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A box-shadow adds shadows around an elements frame</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property e.g. "color:pink" - where "color" is the CSS property and "pink" is the value</li>
          <li>You can use the "*" wildcard symbol to apply a rule to all elelments visible on the page</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors</li>
          <li>The above helps us write DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) Code</li>
          <li>A text-align is a way of positioning a title or heading on a web page</li>
          <li>"The "display" property can be assigned with a block value to assign images on new lines</li>

     <h2>JavaScript</h2>

     <ul>

      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <li>We can use the "console.log" method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
      <li>The script file is linked with the "body" element</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>The order of the code affects the outcome, Javascript is read fro,m top to bottom, and order counts</li>
      <li>We must be intentional about how we set up code</li>
      <li>Conditional statements and loops can be used to control the order in which code is executed</li>
      <li>When a computer encounters and if statement, it will check to see if the condition is true or truthy, the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackts if the value isnt true or has a value that isn't truthy</li>
      <li>The strict equality operator "===" checks to see if two values are equal and returns a boolean result (true for equal, false for not)</li>
      <li>We can use an array to change the value of our variable in larger sets of data as opposed to manually adjusting them</li>
      <li>An index identifies the location of the data item in an array</li>
      <li>Arrays are zero indexed and sequential</li>
      <li>Loops are efficient ways to change the values of the index</li>
      <li>A "for" loop can be used to log each topic from an array in the console</li> 
      <li>It uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
      <li> The first statement determines the starting point for a loop</li>
      <li>The second stateent is a condition, as long as the number in the variable "x" is LESS than the length of the array, the loop will keep running</li>
      <li>The final statement is what allowas the array to iterate over each item, the code "x++" is a shortcut for "x+1"</li>
      <li>Don't forget the curly brackets!</li>

        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

           <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
           <li>There are six head elements, "h1" is the largest and 6 is the smallest, you should only use "h1" once</li>
           <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
           <li>The "p" element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
           <li>The "br" element creates a line break between two blocks of content</li>
           <li>The "a" element is an anchor and creates links to the same or other web pages</li>
           <li>"href" is an attribute which will point to a URL for a link, you need to consider this for things like CSS style sheets</li>
           <li>There are three different list types; "ul" is an unordered list, "ol" is an ordered list and "li" allows you to list items</li>
           <li>The "img" element contains information about images displayed on the webpage and the "src" attribute is most important here as it defines the location of the image</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A box-shadow adds shadows around an elements frame</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property e.g. "color:pink" - where "color" is the CSS property and "pink" is the value</li>
          <li>You can use the "*" wildcard symbol to apply a rule to all elelments visible on the page</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors</li>
          <li>The above helps us write DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) Code</li>
          <li>A text-align is a way of positioning a title or heading on a web page</li>
          <li>"The "display" property can be assigned with a block value to assign images on new lines</li>
